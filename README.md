This was an old project called Nacle which is a wordle but the words have 6 letters and you are on a time limit.
It was a group project with two other members that was completed in April 2023.
All files were delegated and completed by me besides NacleGUI.java, which was mainly worked on by my group mates that I did some debugging on.
And the junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.0-M1.jar, used to test code that was given by the professor.

The original was made private but this was allowed to be public and shows some of my work.
